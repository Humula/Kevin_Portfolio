					      <p>
					      For the first half of my year at airG I was primarily working on feature design and implementation for their flagship game Big Barn World. This involved sketching out concepts, getting them approved, creating mock-ups, and then discussing the mock-ups to developers so that they could be implemented correctly. For the second half of my year at airG I also took on the responsibility of leading a two man team on the design and development of experimental, original games for the company. I took on all roles for the work on these games (game design, art, sound, etc.) except for the programming which was done by my co-worker. I will first discuss my work on Big Barn World, and then my work on leading a two man game design team.

			      		<h2>Big Barn World Feature Development</h2>
			      		<h4>Process - Brainstorming</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		For Big Barn World feature development, the example I will use here is the creation of a new leaderboard system. The primary issue with the current implementation was the use of space, so I had to make sure that my design aimed to display the most information at any one time, without feeling too cluttered. The primary goal was to display at least the top three users for each category on the leaderboard, before the user would need to proceed to a separate page.
			      		</p>
			      		<p>
			      		Since this was a mobile application, I wanted to make use of paradigms that would be familiar to mobile users. After evaluating my initial sketches, I decided to go with the approach of using expanding and collapsing drawers for each category, opening up the option of user customization, as the application would remember which categories had been left open and closed so that a user’s favourite categories would always be open for them. To get to the full leaderboard users would just have to tap on a “Get More” button, bringing them to a similar leaderboard page as the previous design did, but now with customization and previews.

			      		<h4>Process - Tweaking and Refining</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		After nailing down the initial design, I decided to add to the customization even further, by implementing a simple drag-and-drop system so that the leaderboard categories could be reorganized into any order that the user wanted, with the positions being remembered by the application. This would allow the user to group all of their favourite categories at the top, and also allow them to leave certain categories expanded or collapsed depending on which ones they wanted open for quick perusal. My design was then passed off to the development team, where it was implemented into Big Barn World and is now part of the live product.

			      		<h2>Original Game Design Work</h2>
			      		<h4>Process - Brainstorming</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		My process for designing original games at airG would usually start out with identifying an interesting game mechanic, or deviation on a popular game mechanic, and then sketching out ideas that could make use of that mechanic. Since all of these games would be made for mobile devices, I wanted to make use of common control schemes that mobile games use (such as swiping and dragging), but also try to mix up the genre norms and do something a little different.
			      		</p>
			      		<p>
			      		All of the games that I worked on were on a quick turn around (approximately 3 weeks) so I also had to consider making their scope appropriate, as I would be the only one creating the content for these games. Due to this, endless runners were a genre that were easy to develop for, since the content for those is usually procedurally generated. This allowed me to still make interesting core mechanics that could be built off of in the future, while not having to worry about content at the time that I was working on the games. The example screenshots shown in this portfolio are for the games Cyber City Chase and Geometate, both endless runners in a way, but with completely different playstyles and approaches.

			      		<h4>Process - Implementation</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		After sketching out ideas for whatever game we were working on, I would go over the different ideas with my other co-worker on the project. We would discuss the pros and cons of each idea, and see which were more interesting or feasible than others. Once an idea had been decided on, I would type up a design document for it, and then my co-worker would begin programming a basic prototype of the game in Unity, while I would begin work on art assets, UI elements and any needed level design (such as difficulty progression or the variety and type of elements to be procedurally generated).

			      		<p>
			      		Once the prototype for each game had been created by my co-worker, I would begin to implement all of my assets and start working on balancing the game. This would usually involve running the game through and seeing if it matched my hypothesis prior to playing, and then adjusting or even adding values as needed. I would also check to see if the controls for each game felt natural, and if something needed to be changed in terms of how the player progressed, or if there was a gradual difficulty curve present. At this point I would usually also start work on the music and sound effects for the game, creating most of the original music for the games in Cubase.

			      		<h4>The Takeaway</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		One of the most important things I learned from my time at airG was to accept failure, and to use it to help in learning what to do differently next time. At the completion of my year of working at airG, I had designed multiple features for Big Barn World, and had also lead a team of two to create multiple, original games from scratch. Many of the feature designs or games that I created were scrapped, or just did not work out how I expected, but from each failure I learned something new that could be used for the next project. Failure is a natural part of the design process, but often in school projects failure does not come about in such a way that you have to scrap the entire project. As a project lead at airG, it was sometimes even my decision to scrap a project, which was usually a very difficult thing to do. I knew though that I could still take the pieces and ideas that had made up that project, and put them to use elsewhere, learning from each failure and make it a stepping stone to something bigger and better.
			      		</p> 
			      		<p>
			      		One of the other primary things I learned while working at airG is how to design games for mobile. Before this job, I had not done a lot of game design for mobile, and this job taught me a lot about how to approach designing for it. This was true for both the user side of things and also for the business side of things. For the user side of things, I learned a lot about how users will typically interact with a mobile game interface, and how to make elements apparent to users without making them overbearing. I felt it was especially important that users be able to pick up and play the games I designed without even looking at the tutorial, at least in so far as them understanding the basic controls. On the business side of things, I also learned how to design with monetization in mind, as most mobile games do not make their money with an upfront purchase, but instead through micro transactions or other paid services. While this is not my favourite approach, I still think it is useful to have an understanding of how monetization can affect game design.
