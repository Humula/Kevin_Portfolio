					      <p>
					      The goal of this solo project which was completed over the course of three weeks was to create a narrative focused piece of media, and feeling ambitious I chose to create an indie game. I ended up creating a cyberpunk detective RPG through the program RPG Maker, that can be viewed and downloaded below.

			      		<p>
			      		This project started off with me considering what genre and what theme I wanted the game to encapsulate. Once I had decided that the game would be an RPG with a cyberpunk detective theme, I began working on designing mechanics and systems that incorportated the theme while sticking to the conventions of an RPG. I compiled a list of features that were essential to the game (MVP or minimum viable product) and made sure to include those for this version of the game. I am still working on incorporating some of the other features and mechanics that I was not able to include in this version.

			      		<p>
			      		Once the mechanics had been laid out, I began work on creating the art assets for the game, starting with the main characters and the enemies, and then proceeding to create tilesets for the levels. Once all of the assets were created, I began including them in the game, and setting up scripting events to trigger progression, random encounters and cutscenes. Finally I worked on including skills and leveling, and balancing the player characters and the enemies. The work of balancing is still ongoing and is not perfect in the current version of the game unfortunately. Additionally this portion of the game was tested for any progression bugs or other glitches that might have occured, ensuring proper QA standards were met.

			      		<h4>The Takeaway</h4>
			      		<p>
			      		Though the game is not well balanced or feature complete at the moment (it is more of a demo or vertical slice of a larger game), I believe the game contains a good base idea and design, and could turn into something great with more work. Through this project I learned a lot about how to manage time working on a project with various components that need to be combined, as well as how to structure the flow of a level and how to set up an efficient project pipeline for working on a game. This game took a lot of time to make, and was probably not the best idea for a two week project, seeing as a longer time period would have allowed me to create a more polished product. Nevertheless I feel that I learned a lot from this experience about game design and the design process, and have no regrets about perhaps being overly ambitious.
